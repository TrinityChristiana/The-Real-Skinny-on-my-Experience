// Declare a variable (string) that stores your currentJob.
var currentJob = "random";
// Write an if/else if/else conditional statement that is based on each job on your resume and console logs a different statement based on how you felt about that job. 
// For example: if (currentJob === 'junior instructor'), then console log: 'My current job is junior instructor. I LOVE helping! But they don't give me enough free food.' 
if (currentJob === "student") {
  console.log("My current job is being a student. I enjoy going because i get to see my friends and also learn a lot about music.")

// else if (currentJob === 'tooth fairy helper'), then console log 'My current job is tooth fairy helper. I am really just in it for the teeth.'
// For the 'else' statement, write something funny about that not being one of your previous jobs.
// Try changing your current job to another one of your past jobs. Watch how it console logs a different statement when you do.
